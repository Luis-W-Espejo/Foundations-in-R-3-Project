# Scripts on this repo
This repo has only one script and it follows 6 steps:

0.  Using data collected from an experiment using smartphones, accelorometers, etc. we download it and read it propperly into R.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

All the comments for every line of code is in the script.
